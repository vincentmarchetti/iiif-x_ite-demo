IIIF 3D manifest viewer implemented in X_ITE viewer

This project is a Single-Page application which renders a Scene as represented in a IIIF Presentation 4 manifest -- in November 2025 Presentation 4  was a specification in development in IIIF.

The 3D rendering will be accomplished by building an X3D conforming scenegraph within the X_ITE X3D viewer.
